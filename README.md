We have a Group Study discussion [here](https://forums.fast.ai/t/a-walk-with-fastai-study-group-and-online-lectures-megathread/59929/) on the Fast.AI forums for discussing this material and asking specific questions.

* NOTE: This course does **not** have a certification or credit. This is something I have been doing for the past few semesters to help branch fellow Undergraduates at my school into the world of fastai, and this year I am making it much more available.
